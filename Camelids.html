        <h1>Camelids</h1>
        <p>
            The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly
            herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. 
            They have a threechambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in
            two with each part separately mobile; and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They
            have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,
            look longer still. (from Wikipedia)
